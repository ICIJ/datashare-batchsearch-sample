### French IBANs

- Filter on French IBAN

    `/FR[0-9]{2}/`

- Sometimes, OCR confuses "5" and "S"

    `/FR[0-9S]{2}/`

- Match the IBAN written without separator

    `/FR[0-9S]{2}/ OR /FR[0-9S]{2}[0-9S]{10}[0-9a-zA-Z]{11}[0-9S]{2}/`

- I had the idea to add `Ã¬ban` as searched term, but it seems that this condition is too restrictive
- I encountered one occurrence that seems complicated to match : "FR 40 3000 2056 4600 0011 7081 X45" because a regexp
like `fr AND /[0-9]{2}/` will collect to many results. So this one will not be matched.
